# **IOT DEVICE REST API** 🪙🪙

## **Project Description** 
  🔸A shop in London has 2 million IoT tracking devices in the warehouse for sale, of which
half needs configured to meet UK standards. A configured device will have a status
"READY" and an ideal temperature between (-25'C to 85'C).
The configuration process requires a given IoT device to be associated with a SIM
(Subscriber Identification Module) card. The SIM card holds information such as:
• SIM ID - uniquely identify the SIM card.
• Operator code – uniquely identify a mobile operator
• Country – country name, e.g. Italy
• Status – devices status can be Active, Waiting for activation, Blocked or
Deactivated.
The shop can sell a device only if it meets the UK government's industry standard.

# **Task**
  Using the Java programming language, develop a REST API that
  🔹 Returns all devices in the warehouse that are waiting for activation.
  🔹 Management endpoints that enable the shop manager to remove or update a device
     configuration status.
  🔹 Returns an ordered result of devices available for sale.
  🔹 Expected response format should be in JSON.

# **📌Technical Sector**

   🔹MVC 
   
   🔹Security (Authentication & Authorization)

   🔹Using Actuators to check application health

   🔹**Design Patterns**: a)Builder Design Pattern    
                          b)Singleton Design Pattern  

   🔹Enums and Constants to ease the work & clean the code.

   🔹Using Mappers and Helpers 

   🔹Utilizing Docker, as Our App ensures cross-platform compatibility.
